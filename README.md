## Requires

## Creating a new iteration

1. Copy previous iteration folder to create new folder for views, e.g. `/app/views/alpha/v1-0` to `/app/views/alpha/v1-1`
2. Update `/app/views/index.html` with link and header to new iteration

See `/docs/views/examples` for page examples and [prototype documentation](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/tutorials-and-examples) for details on how to handle interactions.
